0:4:17 - 0:4:18: Yes.
0:4:18 - 0:4:19: Yes.
0:4:19 - 0:4:20: Yes.
0:4:20 - 0:4:21: Yes.
0:4:21 - 0:4:22: Yes.
0:4:22 - 0:4:23: Yes.
0:4:23 - 0:4:24: Yes.
0:4:24 - 0:4:25: Yes.
0:4:25 - 0:4:26: Yes.
0:4:26 - 0:4:27: Yes.
0:4:27 - 0:4:28: Yes.
0:4:28 - 0:4:29: Yes.
0:4:29 - 0:4:30: Yes.
0:4:30 - 0:4:31: Yes.
0:4:31 - 0:4:32: Yes.
0:4:32 - 0:4:33: Yes.
0:4:33 - 0:4:39: That would be on their part. They continue with the issue of hiring staff.
0:4:39 - 0:4:52: And they are also asked to sign a plan of action because if we do this, the deviation we have with them is 15% in the golden time.
0:4:52 - 0:5:1: So they are formally asked to sign a plan of action to be able to overcome those deviations that we have.
0:5:1 - 0:5:8: So, in their contract, nothing was stipulated regarding that deviation in the formalization?
0:5:8 - 0:5:20: No, in our contract we stipulate because they are also issues of us while we review policies from the area of contracts and all that.
0:5:20 - 0:5:30: So, let's say it's like part by part, while here they were answered, while they were modifying what was requested, and all that.
0:5:30 - 0:5:35: Because, for example, let's say that the Radicon Demora, in which they were presenting a policy of responsibility,
0:5:35 - 0:5:40: if they had a general contract, the one they had to cover the entire company,
0:5:40 - 0:5:45: here they were reviewing if that policy could be approved or not.
0:5:45 - 0:5:53: So they requested that among the beneficiaries of that policy, they include Caribe Mar and all the protocol there.
0:5:53 - 0:5:56: So let's say that happened a lot, like two months.
0:5:56 - 0:6:2: I went on vacation, I came back, I had not started the contract yet.
0:6:2 - 0:6:10: So that was one of the reasons, and the other one was that they were asking me about that.
0:6:10 - 0:6:16: But let's say that our plan of action is to see what, because there are different qualities, like a control of changes,
0:6:16 - 0:6:22: and then have mapped what they are presenting there, and that is formalized.
0:6:22 - 0:6:37: According to the UNHCR, the delay was basically due to the issue of the cell and the engineering.
0:6:37 - 0:6:44: There was a delay in the definition of an engineering that was the issue of the box.
0:6:44 - 0:6:49: This week, the contractor sent the first version of the engineering of the box,
0:6:49 - 0:6:53: as expected, because it was scheduled for April 5.
0:6:53 - 0:7:1: The second one was the one in Villas-Royal-Oliva, which is the one in 679 and 40.
0:7:1 - 0:7:4: There is the issue of the ANI.
0:7:4 - 0:7:10: We have already started with the ANI, which was scheduled for today's conference.
0:7:10 - 0:7:18: We also updated the date of restart with the contractors from the day of the opening.
0:7:18 - 0:7:24: They update the policies to be able to execute activities in the field.
0:7:24 - 0:7:34: Now, on the ANI part, we only need to sign their intervention, but we can start activities in the field.
0:7:34 - 0:7:42: The GABELA we had there was the issue of mobilization.
0:7:42 - 0:7:53: Later, it will be marked, because that mobilization was eaten by the ANI with its observations in the policies and all that.
0:7:53 - 0:8:4: The new station in Toluviejo, there is that delay of 1% that you present with respect to design issues.
0:8:4 - 0:8:12: They have already given us the formulation, however, if we are a little late with the issue,
0:8:12 - 0:8:23: we will have to give them answers to the formulation and that they do not have the comments, because they will have enough comments about that.
0:8:24 - 0:8:33: The station Carretto, we are going very fast in the chronogram, the aviation is very fast,
0:8:33 - 0:8:51: but if we have the issue of a definition of routes, we are reviewing the formulation to give the answer to the consultant who is taking the 148.
0:8:53 - 0:8:57: It is fine.
0:8:57 - 0:9:0: Yes, Miguel.
0:9:0 - 0:9:4: Well, we continue with the present.
0:9:4 - 0:9:6: It is free.
0:9:24 - 0:9:26: This was published when?
0:9:26 - 0:9:28: Now.
0:9:29 - 0:9:32: He has a presentation there.
0:9:32 - 0:9:34: A presentation?
0:9:34 - 0:9:36: Yes.
0:9:46 - 0:9:49: It looks like a movie.
0:9:49 - 0:9:52: They are all running.
0:9:52 - 0:9:57: The planning should be 100, the one with Panseguita, that did not come out last time.
0:9:57 - 0:10:1: It is surely a single activity or something like that.
0:10:1 - 0:10:3: Something is happening there.
0:10:3 - 0:10:5: I'm going to check.
0:10:5 - 0:10:12: Yes, exactly, Miguel, let's see it again, because it is strange that Panseguita is 5% of the part.
0:10:22 - 0:10:34: There is a way to open it.
0:10:34 - 0:10:37: Yes, I see.
0:10:37 - 0:10:41: But here is the chronogram.
0:10:41 - 0:11:4: It is a payment item, Yamire.
0:11:4 - 0:11:6: It is a payment item.
0:11:6 - 0:11:8: It is a payment item of what?
0:11:8 - 0:11:11: Of TTC and TTS.
0:11:11 - 0:11:14: The team of Patio has not paid yet.
0:11:14 - 0:11:16: Yes, they have already paid.
0:11:16 - 0:11:19: They have not paid yet.
0:11:19 - 0:11:24: But it should mark the 100% of the project's package.
0:11:24 - 0:11:29: But it only has that activity.
0:11:29 - 0:11:33: Ah, Panseguita, we only leave it with that, right?
0:11:33 - 0:11:35: Yes, sir.
0:11:35 - 0:11:38: There we are dead.
0:11:38 - 0:11:39: How?
0:11:39 - 0:11:43: There we are dead because the project is lost.
0:11:43 - 0:11:47: With only a payment item, with the TTC and TTS activity.
0:11:47 - 0:11:52: If they included it for what was inside the NBA, instead of paying, then it is worth it.
0:11:52 - 0:11:55: Panseguita, because this is different if that has a cell.
0:11:55 - 0:11:59: Panseguita expansion.
0:11:59 - 0:12:2: The cell that was asking right now.
0:12:2 - 0:12:5: We are talking about the connection.
0:12:5 - 0:12:10: We can check it now because that could have escaped us when we did the control of the NBA.
0:12:10 - 0:12:16: Although in the NBA it was only Panseguita, the TTC and TTS issue, because I imagine that the cell was not paid this year.
0:12:16 - 0:12:18: It was not in the budget.
0:12:18 - 0:12:24: But well, we are seeing the others and now we check what happened with Panseguita.
0:12:25 - 0:12:27: If it is a need, then...
0:12:27 - 0:12:29: If it is the only activity...
0:12:29 - 0:12:31: ...it is affecting the progress of the NBA.
0:12:31 - 0:12:33: Exactly, not because it was more deviant.
0:12:33 - 0:12:39: It is affecting the requirement as such.
0:12:39 - 0:12:41: Exactly.
0:12:41 - 0:12:47: Ready for the rest. Well, Gambote, the issue of...
0:12:48 - 0:12:50: ...what?
0:12:51 - 0:12:55: Of the delays that the contractist of the control system has had.
0:12:55 - 0:12:59: On Friday the 22nd we responded to that message.
0:12:59 - 0:13:1: They had already sent us.
0:13:1 - 0:13:5: We are waiting for their action plan to be sent to us.
0:13:5 - 0:13:12: They have continued to send the engineering, only that they are showing that delay because, in addition to that...
0:13:12 - 0:13:18: There you can see that the one that is in 1157 is also sent.
0:13:18 - 0:13:21: And the one that is in 2503 replaces Gambote.
0:13:21 - 0:13:39: And Gambote goes to
0:13:42 - 0:13:49: So today we are going to send a presentation to the controller committee.
0:13:49 - 0:13:51: For Wednesday, then...
0:13:51 - 0:13:59: ...request that expansion that we are needing here from the requirer area.
0:13:59 - 0:14:8: So that's why it starts to mark me that Gambote, all the investment projects in Gambote, marks me for the issue of the contractist of the control system.
0:14:8 - 0:14:16: We are going to start now, because we had already put it in the program so that it would have been started, it would have been reactivated.
0:14:16 - 0:14:22: But to reactivate it, as I say, we need all the management of the expansion and then we will be in the middle.
0:14:22 - 0:14:29: Ma'monal 10, there is already the deviation that there is.
0:14:29 - 0:14:33: That is a project that we are going to energize that circuit.
0:14:33 - 0:14:41: We put that date on the service, since as you see in 300% and we can't make a plan of action right now, or a communication.
0:14:41 - 0:14:47: What happens? That circuit we are going to energize it in an existing cell.
0:14:47 - 0:14:56: Since the cells that we have projected for the change of Ma'monal cell, that is with ABV, and those will be executed that other year.
0:14:56 - 0:15:9: So this year to be able to execute this ratio, this new circuit, we are going to use an existing cell that is there in the 138 cell train in the Barragos, which is associated with auxiliary services.
0:15:9 - 0:15:19: We, from high voltage, we already carried out the cell tests and we have already done all the configuration part and we are working in comparison with medium voltage.
0:15:19 - 0:15:28: It is a typical case because it will mark a delay for a date that I stipulate in the schedule, but it is not a punctual activity of us that is delaying it.
0:15:28 - 0:15:33: It is up to us to do there how to take into account, put an asterisk, that deviation.
0:15:33 - 0:15:39: The gumball, what I already told you, the second step of that.
0:15:39 - 0:15:50: So, well, here what happens? This ASSA contract, Advanced Automobilization, which is the one that has all the amplifications of the control system of all this.
0:15:50 - 0:15:59: ASSA, well, it handles two work fronts. Right now we are focused on Algarrogu and in Sagún.
0:15:59 - 0:16:8: In Sagún we are going to put it in service on the 16th, but I think it will be, I better say the date on the 23rd, April 23rd.
0:16:8 - 0:16:21: And Algarrogu on the 17th. So those two work fronts are there and it already starts to mark delays, those control activities that should be executed in San Pueblín and in Tamaalameque.
0:16:21 - 0:16:25: Tamaalameque is there, the one that has 6%.
0:16:25 - 0:16:32: And in what is Talaigua, there is already a topic of what? Of the engineering of the shelter.
0:16:32 - 0:16:44: Magangue is marking me delays, those of the control system, that has PTI, and they sent, I saw that they sent last week a list of signals and an engineering issue.
0:16:44 - 0:16:58: So there it is marking that delay and there it is up to the good to look at now that the 8% passes, that the probabilities that it passes, and then it is already communicated verbally in the reviews that we have done of weekly follow-up with them,
0:16:58 - 0:17:8: because when the 8% of sending passes, then it is up to the good to make a communication in compliance.
0:17:8 - 0:17:14: It is up to the good to verify if the detailed schedule with the review, if it is passing the 8%, which I think can happen, I do not remember.
0:17:14 - 0:17:21: What is Moñitos Astrea are engineering issues, are design issues of the shelters as such.
0:17:21 - 0:17:31: Well, these are the shelters of Avebella, it is in the design part of the control part, so we are there advancing in that.
0:17:31 - 0:17:35: Carmen is the same case as Magangue, problem with the mode.
0:17:35 - 0:17:39: Carmen is the same as Magangue.
0:17:39 - 0:17:45: What else is there?
0:17:45 - 0:17:53: Well, Salguero, Celda, Cortigo, the same case as Magangue and Carmen, three corners, that is a problem of Celda.
0:17:53 - 0:17:59: San Pelayo, San Felipe, all of these are delays associated with the engineering of the shelters.
0:17:59 - 0:18:6: San Monofre, Valencia de Jesús, Arjona, Mandinguilla, Toluviego, San Pelayo, all of these associated with the shelters.
0:18:6 - 0:18:14: All of these are shelters, absolutely everything, up to Boston.
0:18:14 - 0:18:22: Tamarameque, the cable, well Tamarameque, then we have the project of the shelter and the cable transfer.
0:18:22 - 0:18:30: As I was saying, we are now concentrated in Algarro and in Zabun, so there are activities that in the other projects that have the contract,
0:18:30 - 0:18:34: they are seeing there a little affected. The rest are all Celda.
0:18:34 - 0:18:40: These, well, if Monteliba, Anelorica, are projects of replacement of drivers.
0:18:40 - 0:18:50: And what has suddenly advanced a little, are for the issue that I have commented each round of follow-up with the issue of engineering.
0:18:50 - 0:18:56: They are projects that were moved to be executed in 2025, but that to date we already have a design.
0:18:56 - 0:19:1: So that makes time as if I had moved forward in the activity.
0:19:1 - 0:19:8: From the contract, well, the same, to mark the delay of certain projects.
0:19:8 - 0:19:12: I told them, I am Fabilo and I have a delay right away.
0:19:12 - 0:19:23: So there if it is the issue of the engineering of the shelters, to continue marking it and that is going to be closed this month.
0:19:23 - 0:19:31: And then the issue of what, of the shelters and the idea of ​​also moving forward in that.
0:19:31 - 0:19:42: Well, they have sent information there to close the design and the idea was not to leave that message in the air.
0:19:42 - 0:19:48: We responded point by point to what they had manifested so as not to leave that in the air.
0:19:48 - 0:19:54: And what we expect now is that we close that issue and they invite a plant to close the basic engineering.
0:19:54 - 0:20:7: And then continue with the rest of the work as I told you, we are already in the process of expanding the money and the time of that contract, the civil and mutual.
0:20:7 - 0:20:16: The idea is that the control committee of Wednesday goes, I don't know how the process will be, I would understand that the hiring committee would happen.
0:20:16 - 0:20:20: They are going to be injected, they are 600 million additional pesos.
0:20:20 - 0:20:25: That contractor is 3,800, so I hope it goes well together.
0:20:25 - 0:20:34: And already for the rest, well, for the civil works of all these projects that are 20, 23 according to the P.I.
0:20:34 - 0:20:41: We are projecting to debut this year, we are still in market studies, we really just received one before Holy Week.
0:20:41 - 0:20:46: The idea is that this week they invite all those market studies and start that process.
0:20:46 - 0:20:52: Well, I do think that it is time to go together because that one does exceed 5,000.
0:20:52 - 0:20:57: So that's what we have to do for my part.
0:20:57 - 0:20:59: Thank you very much.
0:20:59 - 0:21:1: Thank you.
0:21:29 - 0:21:32: The situation is that
0:21:35 - 0:21:39: Well, it's going to be a start.
0:21:44 - 0:21:50: There are already quite a few recreations above 8%,
0:21:50 - 0:21:57: and the one that is higher would be the two mobile phones of 34, 5.
0:21:57 - 0:22:3: Currently they are in factory tests, they are doing the FAT tests.
0:22:3 - 0:22:9: Last week, well, they were doing all the tests that they do.
0:22:9 - 0:22:18: And next week, the idea is that we come to do the tests with us, the factory.
0:22:18 - 0:22:22: And the office would be scheduled for the week of the 22nd.
0:22:23 - 0:22:28: That is, the next week the FAT test with us and they would be, well, the week of the 15th, they would be
0:22:28 - 0:22:35: disassembling it as a medium and they would be reaching the substations for the week of the 22nd.
0:22:35 - 0:22:40: And later they can do the test of the site.
0:22:40 - 0:22:49: The 2 of 13, 8, the ones that have 13%, their team is already in place, they are in the substations.
0:22:49 - 0:22:58: Where it was said that they would have to go, there are some that are in San Brano and the others are in Monteria.
0:22:58 - 0:23:5: And we are already preparing everything to do the factory tests, the tests on site.
0:23:5 - 0:23:11: There has already been an advance, we are waiting for information there,
0:23:11 - 0:23:18: that web was requested for the issue of personal income, for the permits and all that.
0:23:18 - 0:23:24: And since then, we can start the project there next week.
0:23:24 - 0:23:30: And the one that presents the greatest deviation, well, the deviation project, the one in Montpola,
0:23:30 - 0:23:38: 13.3%, well, we know that it is a contract that is suspended and that we had included in this chronogram,
0:23:38 - 0:23:44: a large amount that was going to be assembled for a desk that was going to be carried out in a civil case.
0:23:44 - 0:23:49: Well, that is actually in the stand-by.
0:23:49 - 0:23:57: What Alberto told us was that they were going to have to join us to review the issue.
0:23:57 - 0:24:2: And also depending on how we are going to go in the control committee with the one of Gambote,
0:24:2 - 0:24:8: we are going to have to ask for a bigger one, with 100 million.
0:24:8 - 0:24:18: So, the one that we first established in Gambote and then we got into doing the issue in the post.
0:24:18 - 0:24:23: Let's see if we always do it by amplification or if we look for production.
0:24:24 - 0:24:30: This week, I think that is already defined and we will see how we do it in the post, in amplification,
0:24:30 - 0:24:34: with what we have to finish.
0:24:34 - 0:24:42: Basically, the cases are practically in the furniture, because the cases were presented in the previous manufacturing.
0:24:42 - 0:24:47: Right now they are in the testing stage,
0:24:47 - 0:24:53: waiting for the 24-5, which are the ones that have the highest deviation rate,
0:24:53 - 0:24:58: to arrive in the week of the 22nd at their station.
0:24:58 - 0:25:3: But already the D138, it can be said that they are ready and available.
0:25:3 - 0:25:5: They are also in cycle.
0:25:5 - 0:25:7: They are in cycle.
0:25:7 - 0:25:11: We are going to go to San Bruno, we would like to see the D138.
0:25:11 - 0:25:14: The one that was made in January.
0:25:18 - 0:25:23: And the advancements correspond to the subject of the measures,
0:25:23 - 0:25:28: corresponding to the technical specifications and solutions that we already have.
0:25:28 - 0:25:35: I imagine that later in the transverse, it will be commented on how the process of the measures is going.
0:25:40 - 0:25:46: That would be basically the summary of the specific project.
0:25:47 - 0:25:52: Jesus, a question.
0:25:52 - 0:25:58: The advance that the chronogram has at the moment is with a cut to what? 22?
0:25:58 - 0:26:1: I made an update right now.
0:26:1 - 0:26:4: I put it with a cut yesterday, 31.
0:26:4 - 0:26:6: Ah, well, perfect.
0:26:6 - 0:26:8: Thank you.
0:26:18 - 0:26:21: No, it's a little bit.
0:26:21 - 0:26:27: Jesus, if you want, we can look at it, transverse it, or we leave it for the last.
0:26:27 - 0:26:30: We leave it for the last.
0:26:30 - 0:26:33: Sebas is connected, right?
0:26:34 - 0:26:37: The host Jose, for sure.
0:26:37 - 0:26:39: Jose is there.
0:26:39 - 0:26:41: Yes, because he is there.
0:26:41 - 0:26:44: He was like sore from something.
0:26:44 - 0:26:50: I don't have anything, but I don't know anything.
0:26:54 - 0:26:57: But did you make any updates?
0:26:57 - 0:26:59: No, nothing.
0:26:59 - 0:27:2: I thought we should look at it.
0:27:2 - 0:27:5: I don't even know the structure we are driving.
0:27:5 - 0:27:9: I would touch it, sit down and interpret it, because it's a fucking machine.
0:27:9 - 0:27:11: Yes, yes.
0:27:12 - 0:27:14: He is over there.
0:27:14 - 0:27:17: He has been like, what, two weeks?
0:27:17 - 0:27:19: One or two.
0:27:19 - 0:27:21: We look at it.
0:27:21 - 0:27:23: We are going to be there.
0:27:23 - 0:27:25: We are going to look.
0:27:25 - 0:27:29: We come every day, because we don't have any delay.
0:27:29 - 0:27:33: I have the chronogram and I update it for the production.
0:27:33 - 0:27:36: I update it on Friday before Tuesday.
0:27:36 - 0:27:38: Ah, you update it on Friday?
0:27:38 - 0:27:40: Yes, on Friday.
0:27:41 - 0:27:47: I have a date of the 22nd.
0:27:47 - 0:27:49: It has to be the 31st.
0:27:49 - 0:27:52: You have to update it to get the indicator.
0:27:52 - 0:27:54: I update it.
0:27:54 - 0:27:57: I look at the main marina, the rest is underpass.
0:27:57 - 0:27:59: I can know more or less where it is going.
0:27:59 - 0:28:1: The road is also countryside.
0:28:1 - 0:28:3: I don't know if it's salvation, but I ask.
0:28:3 - 0:28:6: But the old man says, what is it going to do?
0:28:6 - 0:28:8: I don't know anything.
0:28:8 - 0:28:12: Those who have planned progress are the same.
0:28:22 - 0:28:25: We are going to see with Sebas.
0:28:30 - 0:28:32: I made the update right now.
0:28:32 - 0:28:34: I was not letting myself update.
0:28:34 - 0:28:38: I don't know if it will appear there.
0:28:38 - 0:28:40: If it is the chronogram update.
0:28:58 - 0:29:0: Ready.
0:29:0 - 0:29:3: The project is progressing.
0:29:3 - 0:29:6: We asked for the consignations.
0:29:6 - 0:29:10: They were approved for the 21st of April.
0:29:10 - 0:29:12: For that week.
0:29:12 - 0:29:14: The week of the 22nd to the 26th.
0:29:14 - 0:29:19: We had the meeting with the energy group in Bogotá.
0:29:19 - 0:29:24: We agreed on the work that has to be done for that date.
0:29:24 - 0:29:30: But the consignation for that date was left.
0:29:34 - 0:29:36: The Sagún project.
0:29:36 - 0:29:38: We already did tests.
0:29:38 - 0:29:40: We started doing tests before Easter.
0:29:40 - 0:29:44: We had some problems with the communication channel and the ladder.
0:29:44 - 0:29:48: There was a problem with the ladder that did not allow us to do tests.
0:29:48 - 0:29:52: But it was already fixed and the tests were already advanced.
0:29:52 - 0:29:56: The idea is to finish the last thing that is missing.
0:29:56 - 0:29:58: Without more our and Dani.
0:29:58 - 0:30:0: If this is the consignation.
0:30:0 - 0:30:4: But the idea is that there are very few signs left.
0:30:4 - 0:30:6: And there it advanced.
0:30:6 - 0:30:8: Dani, what a pity.
0:30:8 - 0:30:12: When was the consignation for the service?
0:30:12 - 0:30:14: I was talking to Jaime.
0:30:14 - 0:30:16: He told me that for the 23rd.
0:30:16 - 0:30:18: Ok.
0:30:18 - 0:30:22: We are waiting for that date for the service of the project.
0:30:26 - 0:30:28: The renovation projects.
0:30:28 - 0:30:34: We are in the stage of the whole issue of contract.
0:30:34 - 0:30:36: The issue of Mahangue.
0:30:36 - 0:30:38: I need it to be there.
0:30:38 - 0:30:44: Mahangue is already in construction of the boards.
0:30:44 - 0:30:52: In the assembly of the teams and the boards of the bar differential.
0:30:52 - 0:30:56: We are going there every day.
0:30:56 - 0:30:58: The renovation project.
0:30:58 - 0:31:6: Last week the presentation was sent to the board of directors.
0:31:6 - 0:31:8: This week there is a board of directors.
0:31:8 - 0:31:10: This week there is a board of directors.
0:31:10 - 0:31:18: And with that, we are waiting for approval to send the software.
0:31:18 - 0:31:20: And send it to buy.
0:31:20 - 0:31:22: So that it can be a buyer.
0:31:22 - 0:31:24: This week there is a board of directors.
0:31:24 - 0:31:26: We did all the documentation and presentation.
0:31:26 - 0:31:28: And we are waiting for approval this week.
0:31:28 - 0:31:30: We also have a new sub station.
0:31:30 - 0:31:32: It is the new Watapuri sub station.
0:31:32 - 0:31:34: We also have a new sub station.
0:31:34 - 0:31:36: It is the new Watapuri sub station.
0:31:36 - 0:31:38: It is the new Watapuri sub station.
0:31:38 - 0:31:40: It is the new Watapuri sub station.
0:31:40 - 0:31:42: It is the new Watapuri sub station.
0:31:42 - 0:31:44: It is already sent to buy.
0:31:44 - 0:31:48: So that it can be a buyer.
0:31:48 - 0:31:54: This week we are in the whole issue of documentation.
0:31:54 - 0:32:0: The project of expansion of the transformation and cabinet expansion system.
0:32:0 - 0:32:2: The cabinet and the one of Nueva Torluviejo.
0:32:4 - 0:32:6: We think that the studio mercado Nueva Torluviejo has taken a little bit of time.
0:32:6 - 0:32:10: Because they have asked us for more time for the project.
0:32:10 - 0:32:14: So that is why we have not been able to finish the studio mercado.
0:32:16 - 0:32:18: And that's all.
0:32:24 - 0:32:26: We will not go into translation.
0:32:30 - 0:32:32: Translation.

0:34:22 - 0:34:26: Space to see what is advanced this week. That's how it is.
0:34:26 - 0:34:27: A lot of it.
0:34:27 - 0:34:31: And in the Martelo part, I advance,
0:34:31 - 0:34:39: you tell us please, you show us the excel where Martelo gave us the advances, ready?
0:34:39 - 0:34:40: Yes.
0:34:40 - 0:34:43: Ok, now Jesus.
0:34:43 - 0:34:48: Read, read. The act of now civil and electrical assembly, the Novarjonas station,
0:34:48 - 0:34:51: I understand that Novarjonas is no longer going,
0:34:51 - 0:34:52: so...
0:34:52 - 0:34:54: But official?
0:34:54 - 0:34:59: I don't know if it's official, until now I think it's been said that it's not going,
0:34:59 - 0:35:4: however, I don't know what meeting was held Friday before Easter,
0:35:4 - 0:35:6: I don't know what Alberto told you.
0:35:6 - 0:35:8: Alberto, what did he say?
0:35:8 - 0:35:14: Alberto, what he said is that we are going to do a control of changes,
0:35:14 - 0:35:19: I don't know if this week or the other, it's better to do it,
0:35:19 - 0:35:26: and to get Arjona, Novarjonas, from the chronograms, from the transversal and in fact from Joseph's,
0:35:26 - 0:35:33: and that depending on the definition that is made, it is included again or it is left excluded, yes?
0:35:33 - 0:35:38: Because what has to do with Novarjonas is already marking us delays,
0:35:38 - 0:35:43: both in Joseph's chronogram and in this transversal chronogram,
0:35:44 - 0:35:49: and there is still no definition if it goes or not, and if it goes or not, it starts to generate delays,
0:35:49 - 0:35:54: and not, well, something that does not depend on the team, yes?
0:35:54 - 0:35:58: That's what I told him, so I have to wait and see what he decides,
0:35:58 - 0:36:3: finally, if, as I said, let's start from afar rather,
0:36:3 - 0:36:9: we with the task from tomorrow to start building the control of changes to exclude Novarjonas,
0:36:9 - 0:36:15: and then the session will be organized and all the meetings to present that control of changes.
0:36:19 - 0:36:24: Act 7, design of the station, new station, everything old,
0:36:28 - 0:36:37: that has not had much progress because I would have to confirm right now with Luis Carlos,
0:36:37 - 0:36:42: if they are always going to include it because until the last one, nothing has been done for that,
0:36:42 - 0:36:46: we have to confirm it well with Luis Carlos,
0:36:46 - 0:36:51: that has a basis for the topic of specifications,
0:36:51 - 0:36:55: but as such the control process has not advanced at all,
0:36:55 - 0:36:57: we do not know anything about that,
0:36:57 - 0:36:59: design of the new station, everything old,
0:36:59 - 0:37:5: we would have to confirm it well with Luis Carlos,
0:37:5 - 0:37:7: that has not been assembled, that has not been assembled,
0:37:7 - 0:37:11: and the process of controlling and protecting new stations,
0:37:11 - 0:37:16: those who started it, that process was already assembled,
0:37:16 - 0:37:22: or well, the purchase assignment was already requested,
0:37:22 - 0:37:27: let's wait for them to assign us to start the project,
0:37:28 - 0:37:30: what else?
0:37:30 - 0:37:33: We are Lotes, License of Construction,
0:37:33 - 0:37:35: we are going to transfer it,
0:37:35 - 0:37:39: I am Arti Juan, I am Fabio right now,
0:37:39 - 0:37:42: process of better quality,
0:37:42 - 0:37:45: and we already have market studies,
0:37:45 - 0:37:48: this week the idea is to have everything ready,
0:37:48 - 0:37:50: how to make a private offer,
0:37:50 - 0:37:53: and send it to the financial department,
0:37:53 - 0:37:58: so that they can make the financial assessment
0:37:58 - 0:38:0: of the three providers that we are going to invite,
0:38:0 - 0:38:2: so that it is ready,
0:38:2 - 0:38:5: and I have already left all the documentation ready,
0:38:5 - 0:38:8: to take that process to the contract committee,
0:38:8 - 0:38:11: we hope to be able to take it next week.
0:38:11 - 0:38:21: Well, the act of work is electromechanical,
0:38:21 - 0:38:25: the driver's deposition cabinet,
0:38:25 - 0:38:30: until now we have only received market studies,
0:38:30 - 0:38:34: we are still waiting for at least two more,
0:38:34 - 0:38:36: until the reference three,
0:38:37 - 0:38:39: I think this week,
0:38:39 - 0:38:41: I think that between today and tomorrow,
0:38:41 - 0:38:45: we will be able to start the market.
0:38:47 - 0:38:50: The protection and new protection of all the old,
0:38:50 - 0:38:53: is advancing on the topic of specifications,
0:38:53 - 0:38:55: I don't know Sebastián,
0:38:55 - 0:39:1: if you have any comment about the protection and new protection.
0:39:1 - 0:39:6: Yes, I did a meeting on Tuesday,
0:39:6 - 0:39:8: with all the providers there,
0:39:8 - 0:39:10: to look at the issue of doubts and that,
0:39:10 - 0:39:12: and they asked us this week,
0:39:12 - 0:39:14: to extend a period to see if it was on the market,
0:39:14 - 0:39:16: because they were not working,
0:39:16 - 0:39:18: that week they had lost it,
0:39:18 - 0:39:20: and well,
0:39:20 - 0:39:23: there we gave them a little more time this week,
0:39:23 - 0:39:25: to be able to finish that.
0:39:29 - 0:39:31: Yes, Rafael,
0:39:31 - 0:39:33: the process is simple,
0:39:33 - 0:39:35: of medium tension and transformer,
0:39:35 - 0:39:39: and this week we should be releasing market studies,
0:39:43 - 0:39:45: of cables,
0:39:45 - 0:39:47: the issue of folds,
0:39:47 - 0:39:50: we would have to check with Doris,
0:39:50 - 0:39:52: who is the operator of the game,
0:39:52 - 0:39:56: with the fold,
0:39:56 - 0:39:58: and she is showing
0:39:59 - 0:40:3: a deviation of 7%
0:40:4 - 0:40:9: and we should be releasing it this week,
0:40:9 - 0:40:11: publishing it at the end,
0:40:11 - 0:40:13: we want it to be possible.
0:40:13 - 0:40:17: And the high duty of setting up the transformer,
0:40:17 - 0:40:19: because it would also be the same situation,
0:40:19 - 0:40:21: the market studies,
0:40:21 - 0:40:23: the mobile pages 110,
0:40:23 - 0:40:25: we already have the market studies,
0:40:25 - 0:40:29: we can also organize all the documentation,
0:40:29 - 0:40:31: the same for mobile transformers,
0:40:31 - 0:40:35: we already have the three market studies,
0:40:35 - 0:40:37: to optimize the prices,
0:40:37 - 0:40:41: and it would be to do all the documents that are missing,
0:40:41 - 0:40:43: to get that process and take it to the contract committee,
0:40:43 - 0:40:45: and that would also go to the board of directors,
0:40:45 - 0:40:47: because it is superior to 10 nipers.
0:40:53 - 0:40:55: Well, and well,
0:40:55 - 0:40:57: everything that is now possible,
0:40:57 - 0:40:59: we know that we are going to get it in one or two acts,
0:40:59 - 0:41:3: until now we only have the first act that is going to be released,
0:41:3 - 0:41:5: the market studies,
0:41:5 - 0:41:9: and the design of the Trubaco,
0:41:9 - 0:41:11: that is already legalized, right?
0:41:13 - 0:41:15: I don't know if it is missing there.
0:41:15 - 0:41:17: I think it is there,
0:41:17 - 0:41:19: but we have not done the initial work,
0:41:19 - 0:41:21: we are dilating it a bit,
0:41:21 - 0:41:25: because we do not have the Trubaco,
0:41:25 - 0:41:27: so to be able to start the design,
0:41:27 - 0:41:29: we need to have a designer,
0:41:29 - 0:41:31: you leave here and you get here,
0:41:31 - 0:41:33: and we don't have that lot,
0:41:33 - 0:41:37: so we have to continue that search for the Trubaco lot,
0:41:37 - 0:41:39: to come to that to be able to design the constructor,
0:41:39 - 0:41:41: so we are trying to dilate the issue a bit,
0:41:41 - 0:41:45: but we could already make an initial order,
0:41:45 - 0:41:47: but we would start to eat the time of the contract.
0:41:57 - 0:42:1: That is already marking behind, ok?
0:42:3 - 0:42:5: Yes, it reached 1%.
0:42:9 - 0:42:11: I imagine it does not have an order,
0:42:11 - 0:42:13: because it still does not have the initial order,
0:42:13 - 0:42:15: so that is what it is marking there,
0:42:15 - 0:42:17: that it should be formalized.
0:42:17 - 0:42:19: That one?
0:42:19 - 0:42:21: Yes, it is 99.
0:42:23 - 0:42:25: Basically, that would be it,
0:42:25 - 0:42:27: and the protection control,
0:42:27 - 0:42:29: what we were most ahead of,
0:42:29 - 0:42:31: would be the new suestration,
0:42:31 - 0:42:33: the suestration Guadalpurí,
0:42:33 - 0:42:35: that we are already creating a buyer,
0:42:35 - 0:42:37: the renovation of protections,
0:42:37 - 0:42:39: to the board of directors,
0:42:43 - 0:42:45: and the other that is out there,
0:42:45 - 0:42:47: the protection control,
0:42:47 - 0:42:49: to the market studios,
0:42:49 - 0:42:51: or civil works, also market studios,
0:42:51 - 0:42:53: and what are teams,
0:42:53 - 0:42:55: cell, transformers,
0:42:55 - 0:42:57: and the value team.
0:42:57 - 0:43:1: We are already in the process of structuring everything.
0:43:3 - 0:43:5: Let's quickly summarize.
0:43:19 - 0:43:21: Fabi, are you happy?
0:43:21 - 0:43:23: Yes?
0:43:27 - 0:43:29: I already said that there are some challenges
0:43:29 - 0:43:31: in terms of the procedures.
0:43:33 - 0:43:35: The novelty would be
0:43:35 - 0:43:37: the permission of the national agency
0:43:37 - 0:43:39: of Guadalpurá,
0:43:39 - 0:43:41: that already had policies,
0:43:41 - 0:43:43: and today is the issue of the initial order,
0:43:43 - 0:43:45: the signing.
0:43:47 - 0:43:49: And the challenge,
0:43:49 - 0:43:51: is that the lines,
0:43:51 - 0:43:53: the form of the form of the application,
0:43:53 - 0:43:55: the letter of request,
0:43:55 - 0:43:57: that are like the manager's vocabulary,
0:43:57 - 0:43:59: are pending.
0:43:59 - 0:44:1: Of all those lines,
0:44:1 - 0:44:3: yes, the names,
0:44:3 - 0:44:5: C10, C16, C18,
0:44:5 - 0:44:7: the public spaces, right?
0:44:7 - 0:44:9: Yes, public spaces.
0:44:9 - 0:44:11: That was already done
0:44:11 - 0:44:13: again in all the documents
0:44:13 - 0:44:15: and it was formalized.
0:44:15 - 0:44:17: The book that was starting today.
0:44:17 - 0:44:19: And now,
0:44:19 - 0:44:21: the other one, which was the new recommendation
0:44:21 - 0:44:23: of the Guadalpurín, the construction license,
0:44:23 - 0:44:25: is pending to receive the documentation.
0:44:25 - 0:44:27: It would be content to receive the
0:44:27 - 0:44:29: draft document of March of the same year.
0:44:29 - 0:44:31: Yes, that is the one that
0:44:31 - 0:44:33: we were talking about,
0:44:33 - 0:44:35: that already has
0:44:35 - 0:44:37: a license,
0:44:37 - 0:44:39: but it will be five lives
0:44:39 - 0:44:41: for the new ones.
0:44:41 - 0:44:43: Exactly.
0:44:43 - 0:44:45: Or it will need to be updated.
0:44:47 - 0:44:49: Ok.
0:44:53 - 0:44:55: Well,
0:44:55 - 0:44:57: we will continue with the various
0:44:57 - 0:44:59: issues of execution.
0:44:59 - 0:45:1: As for
0:45:1 - 0:45:3: the risk matrices,
0:45:3 - 0:45:5: the first revision
0:45:5 - 0:45:7: is estimated
0:45:7 - 0:45:9: in the open process
0:45:9 - 0:45:11: and there are
0:45:11 - 0:45:13: several
0:45:13 - 0:45:15: lists,
0:45:15 - 0:45:17: the projects list,
0:45:17 - 0:45:19: except for the delineation,
0:45:19 - 0:45:23: we reviewed the delineation and the matrices were generated.
0:45:23 - 0:45:25: If everything went well, Miguel.
0:45:25 - 0:45:27: The only thing that
0:45:27 - 0:45:29: I am looking at is the scope,
0:45:29 - 0:45:31: we would have to enter one by one to put the scope.
0:45:31 - 0:45:35: If you put the scope from the beginning,
0:45:35 - 0:45:37: if you want, now who is projecting?
0:45:37 - 0:45:39: Me.
0:45:39 - 0:45:41: Well, if you want, we will talk about it.
0:45:41 - 0:45:43: As I send the macro,
0:45:43 - 0:45:45: it fills the first list,
0:45:45 - 0:45:47: which is the introduction.
0:45:49 - 0:45:51: But there is a box
0:45:51 - 0:45:53: below the scope.
0:45:53 - 0:45:55: The scope is the same for all.
0:45:55 - 0:45:57: I don't know if we can...
0:45:57 - 0:45:59: If we enter one by one,
0:45:59 - 0:46:1: because for example, the line reposition
0:46:1 - 0:46:3: is the same scope, the structure reposition...
0:46:5 - 0:46:7: That is a failure because
0:46:7 - 0:46:11: I didn't give it the importance of that part.
0:46:11 - 0:46:13: But that is an auditory,
0:46:13 - 0:46:15: if you look at it, what is the scope of that project?
0:46:15 - 0:46:17: So it's down there.
0:46:17 - 0:46:19: We can put it... well, I only put it in the list.
0:46:23 - 0:46:25: In the list, put that box
0:46:25 - 0:46:27: of scope that already...
0:46:27 - 0:46:29: What is it sounding?
0:46:29 - 0:46:31: That is the operation, that mark.
0:46:31 - 0:46:33: What is happening to him?
0:46:35 - 0:46:37: What?
0:46:37 - 0:46:39: Yes, put that box of scope on the list,
0:46:39 - 0:46:41: the copy down there.
0:46:41 - 0:46:43: And it would be all full.
0:46:43 - 0:46:45: I started to check one by one and it was done.
0:46:47 - 0:46:49: With MIG and INEAS, it was generated.
0:46:51 - 0:46:53: The other concern that arises to me is
0:46:53 - 0:46:55: that if we put the start date,
0:46:55 - 0:46:57: we would have to have the follow-up.
0:46:59 - 0:47:1: Because if not the start date, it would be...
0:47:1 - 0:47:3: The same.
0:47:3 - 0:47:5: The same, exactly.
0:47:5 - 0:47:7: If I put the start date,
0:47:7 - 0:47:9: I would have to have the follow-up.
0:47:11 - 0:47:13: Well, you play with that.
0:47:13 - 0:47:15: If we put the same,
0:47:15 - 0:47:17: maybe one of the disorders, the blue,
0:47:17 - 0:47:19: we implement it from that date,
0:47:19 - 0:47:21: and from that date we have already made follow-ups.
0:47:23 - 0:47:25: But if they are in disorder,
0:47:25 - 0:47:27: and I have one in 2020,
0:47:27 - 0:47:29: I would have to have all the follow-ups.
0:47:29 - 0:47:31: If they are four per year,
0:47:31 - 0:47:33: you should have all the results.
0:47:33 - 0:47:35: That's what you would have to do
0:47:35 - 0:47:37: to talk to Alberto.
0:47:37 - 0:47:39: For example, let's make a follow-up on April 12th.
0:47:41 - 0:47:43: Take that as the first follow-up.
0:47:43 - 0:47:45: Then all the matrixes of arrangement
0:47:45 - 0:47:47: with dates from three months ago,
0:47:47 - 0:47:49: so that you know the first one and we don't start there.
0:47:49 - 0:47:51: It would be like what...
0:47:53 - 0:47:55: Because as the project start date says,
0:47:55 - 0:47:57: many projects started from 2022, 2020.
0:47:59 - 0:48:1: To define the date of the start.
0:48:1 - 0:48:3: The start of the follow-up.
0:48:3 - 0:48:7: Because with that we would have to have all the follow-ups.
0:48:9 - 0:48:11: I would make it easier for everyone to have the date in January,
0:48:11 - 0:48:13: and this one in February,
0:48:13 - 0:48:15: and the first follow-up.
0:48:15 - 0:48:17: And even if it doesn't matter,
0:48:17 - 0:48:19: we are already implementing that follow-up.
0:48:21 - 0:48:23: From January.
0:48:23 - 0:48:25: So that we don't have to think about
0:48:25 - 0:48:27: what was done in 2022.
0:48:31 - 0:48:33: I think you sometimes leave projects ready,
0:48:33 - 0:48:35: but they start years later.
0:48:37 - 0:48:39: So that you can take that commitment
0:48:39 - 0:48:41: to be doing the work.
0:48:43 - 0:48:45: Next, Estarles Eres.
0:48:51 - 0:48:53: I think it's a commitment.
0:48:55 - 0:48:57: As for the projections and execution,
0:48:57 - 0:48:59: the MPA update,
0:49:1 - 0:49:5: that same day after the meeting on March 15,
0:49:5 - 0:49:9: Miguel told us that the update was already done.
0:49:11 - 0:49:13: There was a re-classification,
0:49:13 - 0:49:15: that was already done,
0:49:15 - 0:49:17: but Juan said that it was already done.
0:49:17 - 0:49:19: So the next update is already done.
0:49:19 - 0:49:21: The MPA update was done well,
0:49:21 - 0:49:23: but in the update,
0:49:23 - 0:49:27: a re-classification was already done.
0:49:27 - 0:49:29: But in the end,
0:49:29 - 0:49:31: it was already done.
0:49:31 - 0:49:33: It was done in the whole area.
0:49:35 - 0:49:37: Well, there is also the update note
0:49:37 - 0:49:39: of the projections,
0:49:39 - 0:49:41: once the new substation is defined.
0:49:43 - 0:49:45: So, well, here you already know
0:49:45 - 0:49:47: what Fabi told us,
0:49:47 - 0:49:49: it would be to update the chronograms
0:49:49 - 0:49:51: and suddenly also the MPA.
0:49:53 - 0:49:55: Oh, really, in the subject of projections,
0:49:55 - 0:49:57: in the end, how did that thing look?
0:49:59 - 0:50:1: That was simulated
0:50:1 - 0:50:3: with the pesos that we put,
0:50:3 - 0:50:5: the payment dates that we put in the MPA,
0:50:5 - 0:50:7: it was simulated as if it were in Curri.
0:50:9 - 0:50:11: Yes.
0:50:11 - 0:50:13: Yes, of course.
0:50:13 - 0:50:15: And we did,
0:50:15 - 0:50:17: what day did I send you
0:50:19 - 0:50:21: the displacements?
0:50:21 - 0:50:23: And I'm going to return,
0:50:23 - 0:50:25: I'm going to send you the most clarity,
0:50:27 - 0:50:29: how the projections were.
0:50:29 - 0:50:31: We started from an MPA
0:50:31 - 0:50:33: that they gave us,
0:50:33 - 0:50:35: Juan shared with us.
0:50:35 - 0:50:37: That week I was there,
0:50:37 - 0:50:39: that week they sent us an MPA.
0:50:39 - 0:50:41: And with that MPA,
0:50:41 - 0:50:43: it was taken as a baseline,
0:50:43 - 0:50:45: which is what Alberto talked about.
0:50:45 - 0:50:47: With that, the connection was made
0:50:47 - 0:50:49: with the virtual chronograms,
0:50:49 - 0:50:51: the payment dates,
0:50:51 - 0:50:53: and the cloning was taken out
0:50:53 - 0:50:55: according to those payment dates
0:50:55 - 0:50:57: and what the chronograms gave us.
0:50:59 - 0:51:1: And that was our baseline
0:51:1 - 0:51:3: for what was built in virtual.
0:51:5 - 0:51:7: And now,
0:51:7 - 0:51:9: Abra shared them all
0:51:9 - 0:51:11: the same.
0:51:11 - 0:51:13: And depending on the advances
0:51:13 - 0:51:15: that are made week by week
0:51:15 - 0:51:17: in the projects, it works the same, Miguel.
0:51:17 - 0:51:19: You can see the displacements.
0:51:19 - 0:51:21: I think, I don't remember,
0:51:21 - 0:51:23: but last week,
0:51:23 - 0:51:25: not last week,
0:51:25 - 0:51:27: I was going to download the artwork
0:51:27 - 0:51:29: as we were doing.
0:51:29 - 0:51:31: It's the same format,
0:51:31 - 0:51:33: it's running the same format.
0:51:33 - 0:51:35: Yes, it's in the same format,
0:51:35 - 0:51:37: but you can still download it.
0:51:37 - 0:51:39: I sent it to you on the 21st,
0:51:39 - 0:51:41: March 21st.
0:51:43 - 0:51:45: He laughed.
0:51:45 - 0:51:47: Ready? I sent them all,
0:51:47 - 0:51:49: I shared them all,
0:51:49 - 0:51:51: the displacements, to that cut.
0:51:51 - 0:51:53: So, I'm going to
0:51:53 - 0:51:55: send them tomorrow.
0:51:55 - 0:51:57: I'll tell them to send it back tomorrow
0:51:57 - 0:51:59: and I'll send it tomorrow.
0:51:59 - 0:52:1: I'll make sure they have it all.
0:52:1 - 0:52:3: I'll put it on a sheet,
0:52:3 - 0:52:5: as planned,
0:52:5 - 0:52:7: but it was according to that baseline,
0:52:7 - 0:52:9: at that time, with the MPA,
0:52:9 - 0:52:11: that was the baseline.
0:52:13 - 0:52:15: And the displacements,
0:52:15 - 0:52:17: as all the chronos were updated with cut yesterday,
0:52:17 - 0:52:19: I'm going to tell them to run it
0:52:19 - 0:52:21: so it shows us
0:52:21 - 0:52:23: how the budget would be
0:52:23 - 0:52:25: displaced according to those updates.
0:52:25 - 0:52:27: I'll leave that task to you,
0:52:27 - 0:52:29: Juan Andalés.
0:52:37 - 0:52:39: Well, we have several questions.
0:52:39 - 0:52:41: The process continues,
0:52:41 - 0:52:43: the subsequent
0:52:43 - 0:52:45: order of change with the
0:52:45 - 0:52:47: purchasing processes that are going to
0:52:47 - 0:52:49: be subdivided.
0:52:49 - 0:52:51: Additionally, the definition
0:52:51 - 0:52:53: of Nueva Aljona,
0:52:53 - 0:52:55: right? And
0:52:55 - 0:52:57: I don't know what I was talking about with Fábio
0:52:57 - 0:52:59: these days,
0:52:59 - 0:53:1: the topics that you have already identified
0:53:1 - 0:53:3: in your chronograms,
0:53:3 - 0:53:5: that could be connection errors
0:53:5 - 0:53:7: in the logical sequence,
0:53:7 - 0:53:9: activities,
0:53:9 - 0:53:11: let's say, yes, particularities
0:53:11 - 0:53:13: that could be adjusted
0:53:13 - 0:53:15: at once,
0:53:15 - 0:53:17: have them listed at once,
0:53:17 - 0:53:19: that is, referenced by the
0:53:19 - 0:53:21: legislation, what is the modification,
0:53:21 - 0:53:23: to include them within a modification,
0:53:23 - 0:53:25: a large order of change,
0:53:25 - 0:53:27: not to carry out a particular
0:53:27 - 0:53:29: change order
0:53:29 - 0:53:31: on such small
0:53:31 - 0:53:33: issues, right?
0:53:33 - 0:53:35: So, yes,
0:53:35 - 0:53:37: have them listed there always
0:53:37 - 0:53:39: present, and that will continue to happen
0:53:39 - 0:53:41: because, well, there is no perfect chronogram,
0:53:41 - 0:53:43: those things happen all the time.
0:53:57 - 0:53:59: And well, on the other hand, we have
0:53:59 - 0:54:1: the follow-up of the
0:54:1 - 0:54:3: commitments,
0:54:3 - 0:54:5: which we have
0:54:5 - 0:54:7: here
0:54:7 - 0:54:9: to complete a meeting
0:54:9 - 0:54:11: with the maintenance area,
0:54:11 - 0:54:13: in which
0:54:13 - 0:54:15: agreements were reached
0:54:15 - 0:54:17: which support the change
0:54:17 - 0:54:19: order.
0:54:19 - 0:54:21: And that commitment is also linked to
0:54:21 - 0:54:23: the following, which is to share
0:54:23 - 0:54:25: the relation of where the measures were installed.
0:54:27 - 0:54:29: It's open, and I could already
0:54:29 - 0:54:31: talk to Manuel, he told me that
0:54:31 - 0:54:33: tomorrow we are going to review the topic,
0:54:33 - 0:54:35: and he will take the step to review and close it.
0:54:35 - 0:54:37: So,
0:54:37 - 0:54:39: we are going to be together
0:54:39 - 0:54:41: as a meeting date.
0:54:45 - 0:54:47: Here is also
0:54:47 - 0:54:49: the file license
0:54:49 - 0:54:51: of related activities
0:54:51 - 0:54:53: executed and pending
0:54:53 - 0:54:55: by project.
0:54:55 - 0:54:57: That had a delivery date on March 30.
0:54:57 - 0:54:59: The date
0:54:59 - 0:55:1: was not counted with advance
0:55:1 - 0:55:3: regarding the projects,
0:55:3 - 0:55:5: so you can tell us
0:55:5 - 0:55:7: if there is any news.
0:55:11 - 0:55:13: Which one?
0:55:13 - 0:55:15: The file license
0:55:15 - 0:55:17: of related activities executed
0:55:17 - 0:55:19: and pending by project.
0:55:21 - 0:55:23: Which file?
0:55:23 - 0:55:25: That file came from
0:55:25 - 0:55:27: the audit of the
0:55:27 - 0:55:29: system of investment,
0:55:29 - 0:55:31: where it was requested
0:55:31 - 0:55:33: to give us the ability
0:55:33 - 0:55:35: to know what
0:55:35 - 0:55:37: activities of the chronograms,
0:55:37 - 0:55:39: let's say the chronograms from 2023
0:55:39 - 0:55:41: are closed
0:55:41 - 0:55:43: and which ones are pending.
0:55:47 - 0:55:49: Manuel, we are going to review
0:55:49 - 0:55:51: the file license.
0:55:51 - 0:55:53: Can I give it back?
0:55:53 - 0:55:55: I give it back.
0:55:57 - 0:55:59: Send it to me, please.
0:55:59 - 0:56:1: That's the commitment,
0:56:1 - 0:56:3: as it has a good time.
0:56:3 - 0:56:5: We would have to take
0:56:5 - 0:56:7: the previous chronogram
0:56:7 - 0:56:9: and see what is left.
0:56:9 - 0:56:11: All that would be completed.
0:56:11 - 0:56:13: Or how the file is structured.
0:56:13 - 0:56:15: Yes, it's an Excel.
0:56:15 - 0:56:17: Exactly.
0:56:17 - 0:56:19: An Excel that has all the projects.
0:56:19 - 0:56:21: And an observation is left.
0:56:25 - 0:56:27: Send the search results.
0:56:29 - 0:56:31: The most practical would be
0:56:31 - 0:56:33: what is left in execution
0:56:33 - 0:56:35: or in zero, and if it continues
0:56:35 - 0:56:37: in the next chronogram or
0:56:37 - 0:56:39: is discarded for this reason.
0:56:41 - 0:56:43: As for the pending file,
0:56:43 - 0:56:45: it was not carried out.
0:56:45 - 0:56:47: That's why.
0:56:53 - 0:56:55: There is one of the
0:56:55 - 0:56:57: Curbacol substations
0:56:57 - 0:56:59: referring to the lot
0:57:1 - 0:57:3: in which information was requested
0:57:3 - 0:57:5: from the area
0:57:5 - 0:57:7: and dimensions.
0:57:7 - 0:57:9: That commitment was fulfilled.
0:57:13 - 0:57:15: Another of the commitments is
0:57:15 - 0:57:17: to update risk matrices.
0:57:17 - 0:57:19: As we mentioned
0:57:19 - 0:57:21: previously,
0:57:21 - 0:57:23: the first revision
0:57:23 - 0:57:25: will be carried out on April 12.
0:57:25 - 0:57:27: We are still
0:57:27 - 0:57:29: pending to publish
0:57:29 - 0:57:31: the files of four or five projects.
0:57:35 - 0:57:37: Review the chronogram
0:57:37 - 0:57:39: of the Quad App contract
0:57:39 - 0:57:41: as a non-conformity justification
0:57:41 - 0:57:43: and evaluate the general delays
0:57:43 - 0:57:45: that are involved in the
0:57:45 - 0:57:47: project's chronogram.
0:57:47 - 0:57:49: Daniel mentioned it to us
0:57:49 - 0:57:51: now in the
0:57:51 - 0:57:53: follow-up that is done
0:57:53 - 0:57:55: with the Gambozte project chronogram.
0:57:57 - 0:57:59: According to what we have,
0:57:59 - 0:58:1: the communication was already
0:58:1 - 0:58:3: answered in that phase
0:58:3 - 0:58:5: of questions and answers.
0:58:7 - 0:58:9: The next thing
0:58:9 - 0:58:11: is to release
0:58:11 - 0:58:13: that non-conformity process
0:58:13 - 0:58:15: if necessary
0:58:15 - 0:58:17: and also
0:58:17 - 0:58:19: the following steps
0:58:19 - 0:58:21: and the information resulting
0:58:21 - 0:58:23: from the plan of action.
0:58:25 - 0:58:27: Finish the documents
0:58:27 - 0:58:29: required for the expansion of the contract
0:58:29 - 0:58:31: with EMS
0:58:31 - 0:58:33: for non-post compensation
0:58:33 - 0:58:35: and be able to take the contract
0:58:35 - 0:58:37: committee.
0:58:37 - 0:58:39: That was the follow-up.
0:58:39 - 0:58:41: I understood now that
0:58:41 - 0:58:43: it already has a value of even
0:58:43 - 0:58:45: 600 million.
0:58:45 - 0:58:47: Or 1600 more or less.
0:58:47 - 0:58:49: Ok.
0:58:49 - 0:58:51: That topic
0:58:51 - 0:58:53: I think we will do it well.
0:58:55 - 0:58:57: The documents were finalized
0:58:57 - 0:58:59: but a revision will be done.
0:58:59 - 0:59:1: Ok, well
0:59:1 - 0:59:3: I will leave it there.
0:59:3 - 0:59:5: A follow-up of
0:59:5 - 0:59:7: the new Arjona substation plot
0:59:7 - 0:59:9: and then a plan
0:59:9 - 0:59:11: sending
0:59:11 - 0:59:13: from the Aria Tecnica.
0:59:13 - 0:59:15: That commitment appears to be
0:59:15 - 0:59:17: paused.
0:59:17 - 0:59:19: I assume that now with this new
0:59:19 - 0:59:21: alignment of
0:59:21 - 0:59:23: the non-viability of Arjona
0:59:23 - 0:59:25: this year, then
0:59:25 - 0:59:27: it will continue to be paused and
0:59:27 - 0:59:29: I would believe that the most sensible
0:59:29 - 0:59:31: is to draw that commitment.
0:59:37 - 0:59:39: The other commitment
0:59:39 - 0:59:41: we have is to disassemble Solpe
0:59:41 - 0:59:43: of the cable and power
0:59:43 - 0:59:45: equipment 110
0:59:45 - 0:59:47: and subsequent
0:59:47 - 0:59:49: following the purchase assignment.
0:59:49 - 0:59:51: That commitment was fulfilled.
0:59:53 - 0:59:55: Following the formalization
0:59:55 - 0:59:57: of the contract of Acta 6
0:59:57 - 0:59:59: design of the Sturmbach line.
0:59:59 - 1:0:1: Those are the follow-ups.
1:0:5 - 1:0:7: That is the sub-supply.
1:0:7 - 1:0:9: I understood now that
1:0:9 - 1:0:11: the only pending
1:0:11 - 1:0:13: is the formalization.
1:0:13 - 1:0:15: Yes.
1:0:15 - 1:0:17: It is still pending.
1:0:17 - 1:0:19: It is still a follow-up.
1:0:21 - 1:0:23: A follow-up meeting
1:0:23 - 1:0:25: to the process of slots with
1:0:25 - 1:0:27: Juan Sebastián, the real estate manager.
1:0:27 - 1:0:29: In that meeting,
1:0:29 - 1:0:31: what is pending is the phase
1:0:31 - 1:0:33: with the expansion projects
1:0:33 - 1:0:35: with Daniel.
1:0:35 - 1:0:37: This follow-up,
1:0:37 - 1:0:39: do you have any date estimated?
1:0:41 - 1:0:43: We have said that it was before.
1:0:43 - 1:0:45: No, it was only pending
1:0:45 - 1:0:47: for the phase with you.
1:0:47 - 1:0:49: What is it?
1:0:49 - 1:0:51: A follow-up meeting
1:0:51 - 1:0:53: where the priority is
1:0:53 - 1:0:55: the importance
1:0:55 - 1:0:57: of the slots.
1:0:57 - 1:0:59: I think it was this Thursday.
1:0:59 - 1:1:1: Because on Fridays I have
1:1:1 - 1:1:3: the whole day.
1:1:3 - 1:1:5: I heard from Fabi that there was a meeting
1:1:5 - 1:1:7: with him on Friday.
1:1:7 - 1:1:9: I don't know if it was.
1:1:9 - 1:1:11: Let's see.
1:1:11 - 1:1:13: It is like 3 pm.
1:1:13 - 1:1:15: Friday is 3 pm.
1:1:15 - 1:1:17: Do you have that time?
1:1:17 - 1:1:19: Yes, I have the meeting every morning on Fridays.
1:1:19 - 1:1:21: I have it here on my computer.
1:1:23 - 1:1:25: If not, could you do it on Thursday?
1:1:29 - 1:1:31: I could do it
1:1:31 - 1:1:33: at 10 am.
1:1:33 - 1:1:35: Good afternoon.
1:1:35 - 1:1:37: Until 9 am on Friday.
1:1:37 - 1:1:39: I can't do it now.
1:1:39 - 1:1:41: Until 9 am.
1:1:43 - 1:1:45: Let's see.
1:1:45 - 1:1:47: We all agree.
1:1:47 - 1:1:49: Yes.
1:1:49 - 1:1:51: We agree.
1:1:51 - 1:1:53: Yes.
1:1:53 - 1:1:55: Update
1:1:55 - 1:1:57: MPA for project lines.
1:1:57 - 1:1:59: That is what
1:1:59 - 1:2:1: the update is about.
1:2:1 - 1:2:3: Finish
1:2:3 - 1:2:5: documentation and create
1:2:5 - 1:2:7: a contract extension
1:2:7 - 1:2:9: solution
1:2:9 - 1:2:11: which does not go to
1:2:11 - 1:2:13: the board of directors
1:2:13 - 1:2:15: for project replacement
1:2:15 - 1:2:17: of a boat.
1:2:17 - 1:2:19: That is what it is.
1:2:19 - 1:2:21: What is that?
1:2:21 - 1:2:23: Finish documentation
1:2:23 - 1:2:25: and create a contract extension
1:2:25 - 1:2:27: solution which does not go to
1:2:27 - 1:2:29: the board of directors.
1:2:29 - 1:2:31: That is what I was saying.
1:2:31 - 1:2:33: We are doing a presentation for the
1:2:33 - 1:2:35: project on Thursday.
1:2:35 - 1:2:37: We are going to inject 600 million
1:2:37 - 1:2:39: and hire 3,800.
1:2:39 - 1:2:41: I am doing all that management.
1:2:41 - 1:2:43: The idea is to reserve the project
1:2:43 - 1:2:45: today and present it.
1:2:45 - 1:2:47: That will never come down
1:2:47 - 1:2:49: because they are less than
1:2:49 - 1:2:51: 100,000.
1:2:55 - 1:2:57: Well, it is
1:2:57 - 1:2:59: finished.
1:2:59 - 1:3:1: Yes, presentation is ready.
1:3:1 - 1:3:3: Alberto gives him the move
1:3:3 - 1:3:5: and it comes out.
1:3:5 - 1:3:7: Presentation
1:3:7 - 1:3:9: for hiring committees
1:3:9 - 1:3:11: regarding the process
1:3:11 - 1:3:13: of control and protection
1:3:13 - 1:3:15: under the 2024
1:3:15 - 1:3:17: sub-station.
1:3:17 - 1:3:19: Sebas, how does
1:3:19 - 1:3:21: that presentation look?
1:3:31 - 1:3:33: Sebas is not listening.
1:3:33 - 1:3:35: Yes, yes, repeat it.
1:3:35 - 1:3:37: I did not understand you.
1:3:37 - 1:3:39: The process of new
1:3:39 - 1:3:41: sub-station?
1:3:41 - 1:3:43: Yes.
1:3:43 - 1:3:45: Presentation
1:3:45 - 1:3:47: for hiring committees
1:3:47 - 1:3:49: regarding the process
1:3:49 - 1:3:51: of control and protection
1:3:51 - 1:3:53: of new sub-station in 2024.
1:3:53 - 1:3:55: Yes, correct.
1:3:55 - 1:3:57: That one was presented on Friday,
1:3:57 - 1:3:59: March 22.
1:3:59 - 1:4:1: They approved it
1:4:1 - 1:4:3: and the Solpex was generated
1:4:3 - 1:4:5: and sent to buy
1:4:5 - 1:4:7: so that it would sign a buyer.
1:4:7 - 1:4:9: That one was very advanced.
1:4:11 - 1:4:13: That is on the
1:4:13 - 1:4:15: buying side.
1:4:15 - 1:4:17: We are waiting for Claudia to sign a buyer.
1:4:17 - 1:4:19: I sent the email
1:4:19 - 1:4:21: on the same day, March 22.
1:4:23 - 1:4:25: We approved it and we sent it
1:4:25 - 1:4:27: at once.
1:4:27 - 1:4:29: Here you have another
1:4:29 - 1:4:31: one, Sebas.
1:4:31 - 1:4:33: You have one that says
1:4:33 - 1:4:35: to send an email to Claudia and José Pertus
1:4:35 - 1:4:37: for hiring review
1:4:37 - 1:4:39: before presentation of the board
1:4:39 - 1:4:41: for the
1:4:41 - 1:4:43: process of protection renewal.
1:4:43 - 1:4:45: Well,
1:4:45 - 1:4:47: the issue was not sent
1:4:47 - 1:4:49: to do the hiring,
1:4:49 - 1:4:51: but this week
1:4:51 - 1:4:53: we did the presentation
1:4:53 - 1:4:55: and we are waiting for the board
1:4:55 - 1:4:57: to approve this week
1:4:57 - 1:4:59: that process.
1:4:59 - 1:5:1: We did not do the hiring
1:5:1 - 1:5:3: before the approval,
1:5:3 - 1:5:5: but with the Solpex
1:5:5 - 1:5:7: once approved,
1:5:7 - 1:5:9: this week
1:5:9 - 1:5:11: we will do that
1:5:11 - 1:5:13: activity.
1:5:15 - 1:5:17: Can this
1:5:17 - 1:5:19: commitment be fulfilled?
1:5:19 - 1:5:21: The final commitment
1:5:21 - 1:5:23: is to do the hiring,
1:5:23 - 1:5:25: but we have not done it.
1:5:25 - 1:5:27: We have not done the hiring
1:5:27 - 1:5:29: because we were going to do it before
1:5:29 - 1:5:31: the board meeting because we thought
1:5:31 - 1:5:33: it would be extended.
1:5:33 - 1:5:35: But it will be a board meeting
1:5:35 - 1:5:37: for approval. It is extraordinary.
1:5:37 - 1:5:39: That, without a doubt, I am not.
1:5:41 - 1:5:43: This week, and we are going
1:5:43 - 1:5:45: to wait this week for the project
1:5:45 - 1:5:47: to be approved to do the whole
1:5:47 - 1:5:49: normal procedure, that is, with
1:5:49 - 1:5:51: the Solpex and when the buyer is assigned,
1:5:51 - 1:5:53: we do the
1:5:53 - 1:5:55: hiring.
1:5:55 - 1:5:57: That is what we wanted to do,
1:5:57 - 1:5:59: but since the board meeting was
1:5:59 - 1:6:1: done this week,
1:6:1 - 1:6:3: we are going to take advantage of
1:6:3 - 1:6:5: the approval this week
1:6:5 - 1:6:7: and with that we would do the hiring.
1:6:11 - 1:6:13: And you have another one here
1:6:13 - 1:6:15: that is called finalization
1:6:15 - 1:6:17: of market studies for the
1:6:17 - 1:6:19: control and protection process
1:6:19 - 1:6:21: of the Tolujer substation.
1:6:21 - 1:6:23: That is the one that was asked this week
1:6:23 - 1:6:25: on Tuesday, the Holy Week,
1:6:25 - 1:6:27: which happened on the 26th. I met with them
1:6:27 - 1:6:29: and they asked me to give them
1:6:29 - 1:6:31: this additional week
1:6:31 - 1:6:33: to finish the market study.
1:6:37 - 1:6:39: Ok, well, that's the process.
1:6:39 - 1:6:41: Exactly.
1:6:41 - 1:6:43: Here we have one from Jose
1:6:43 - 1:6:45: that is to request a current construction license
1:6:45 - 1:6:47: for the new substation
1:6:47 - 1:6:49: for the Holy Week, issued by the investor.
1:6:51 - 1:6:53: Request what?
1:6:53 - 1:6:55: Request the current construction license.
1:6:55 - 1:6:57: I have to ask Alberto
1:6:57 - 1:6:59: because if they already got it out
1:6:59 - 1:7:1: yes.
1:7:1 - 1:7:3: That is, is it the one that the investor currently has?
1:7:3 - 1:7:5: That is what we have commented on.
1:7:5 - 1:7:7: That would be the one that
1:7:7 - 1:7:9: would be accepted by the investors.
1:7:9 - 1:7:11: Yes, yes,
1:7:11 - 1:7:13: accepted by the investor.
1:7:13 - 1:7:15: Ok.
1:7:15 - 1:7:17: And here we have
1:7:17 - 1:7:19: one from Jesus that says
1:7:19 - 1:7:21: response to
1:7:21 - 1:7:23: buyer observations in the
1:7:23 - 1:7:25: cable and power accessories process
1:7:25 - 1:7:27: in the Holy Week. Yes, that's already done.
1:7:27 - 1:7:29: We have received
1:7:29 - 1:7:31: more observations. We are waiting
1:7:31 - 1:7:33: for them to send us the request to
1:7:33 - 1:7:35: give them a good look.
1:7:37 - 1:7:39: Well, the guys have
1:7:39 - 1:7:41: some other commitment,
1:7:41 - 1:7:43: some topic to add.
1:7:57 - 1:7:59: I already sent them the activities,
1:7:59 - 1:8:1: the email where Alex was,
1:8:1 - 1:8:3: ready for them to check it out?
1:8:3 - 1:8:5: Ready, Fabio, thank you.
1:8:5 - 1:8:7: Well,
1:8:7 - 1:8:9: may it not give up.
1:8:9 - 1:8:11: Thank you.
1:8:11 - 1:8:13: Fabio, thank you.
1:8:13 - 1:8:15: How?
1:8:17 - 1:8:19: I don't regret this week
1:8:19 - 1:8:21: because I already know.
1:8:21 - 1:8:23: Amen.
1:8:23 - 1:8:25: Bye.
1:8:25 - 1:8:27: A hug for everyone.
1:8:27 - 1:8:29: Bye.
1:8:39 - 1:8:41: you
1:9:9 - 1:9:11: you
